<br>
Post-doctoral fellow at the Biochemistry Department of the
University of Geneva, in the group of <a
href='https://www.unige.ch/sciences/biochimie/labs/karsten-kruse/'>Karsten
Kruse</a>.

Previously PhD in the <a
href='https://sites.google.com/view/theory-of-complex-systems/welcome?authuser=0'>theory
group</a> of the MSC lab, working under the supervision of <a
href='https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/julien-tailleur/'>Julien
Tailleur</a>.

My research focus is theoretical statistical physics, in particular
with applications to biological and synthetic active systems. More
specifically, I am interested in relating the microscopic dynamics of
active systems to their large-scale emergent behaviors. Bridging this
gap can provide a deeper understanding on the self-organization of
living matter and, possibly, inspire the design of controllable active
materials.
